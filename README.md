### Personal projects I've worked on over the years

[Chaos](https://github.com/danielmend/personal-projects/tree/master/chaos) - a project to generate novel chaotic attractors. The notebook generates an animated gif of a (hopefully) never-before-seen chaotic attractor. I was inspired to create this after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idpOunnpKTo). I wrote this notebook over the course of a 13 hour flight during the summer after my senior year of high school. 

[Connect4](https://github.com/danielmend/personal-projects/tree/master/connect4) - an AI connect-4 opponent. I wrote this during my Advanced Algorithms class in my Junior year of high school. The notebook implements the connect-4 game as well as a bot that uses minimax to play against you. This bot almost beat my teacher.

[Spiral Intersections](https://github.com/danielmend/personal-projects/tree/master/spiral_intersections) - computing intersections of lines and parametric curves. Written during my freshman year of college. Inspired by my friend Griffin who was having difficulty computing the intersection of a line and a spiral. In order to compute intersections, you can project a rectangle between each (x,y) coordinate of both the line and spiral and then check for overlapping rectangles. 

[StyleGAN-2 Visualizer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WtZmXYrRJ5GoK1C9wLSt2hjaTxycQiG9?usp=sharing) - using StyleGAN to create music visualizers. Inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/e23ezq/p_using_stylegan_to_make_a_music_visualizer/), I decided to try my recreating this algorithm on my own. I used a  pretrained StyleGAN-2 google Colab to do this during my Junior year of high school. Sample outputs can be found [here](https://github.com/danielmend/personal-projects/tree/master/StyleGAN_visualizer/samples)
